Edited by Renyu Hu on Oct. 28, 2010

Each row is one molecule or aerosol

The definition of column:

1	Name of the molecule or aerosol
	Use the official exactly as shown in List_Check.xls
	All letters are in Capital

2	Type of Treatment
	X	Normal Molecules in the main loop
	F	Fast Molecules using photochemical equilibrium
	C	Molecules with constant mixing ratio
	A	Aerosols

3	Standard ID Number in the model
	Check the standard ID number in List_Check.xls

4	Molecular Mass in the Atomic Mass Unit

5	Initial Mixing Ratio
	To be applied at the beginning of the calculation
	The sum of this column should be equal to 1

6	Upper Boundary Flux Besides Escape
	The thermal escape has been considered in the model
	The flux is defined positive upwards
	The unit is molecule cm-2 s-1

7	Lower Boundary Type
	1	fixed mixing ratio
	2	fixed flux

8	Dry Deposition Velocity
	in unit of cm s-1
	
9	Lower Boundary Flux
	If column7=1, the mixing ratio of the bottom layer should be given here
	If column7=2, the flux from the ground to the bottom layer should be given here.
	The unit of flux is molecule cm-2 s-1 and positive upwards
