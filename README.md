# EPACRIS
Version 1.0

EPACRIS (ExoPlanet Atmospheric Chemistry & Radiative Interaction Simulator) is a tool to compute the pressure-temperature profile and chemical composition of exoplanet atmospheres, based on fundamental principles and user-specified initial and boundary conditions.

EPACRIS has the capability of simulating massive atmospheres of gaseous planets, thin atmospheres of terrestrial planets and exoplanets (e.g., Earth, Mars, Venus, and rocku exoplanets), and intermediate atmospheres of sub-Neptunes, the most populous type of planets in the Galaxy.

EPACRIS is coded in C.

The current version includes the climate module of EPACRIS, i.e., the computation of pressure-temperature profiles in radiative-convective equilibrium.

Future release will include the chemistry module.
